#### Description:
Desi Charades is an digitized and indian version of the good old favourite dumbcharades game.

Dumb charades is a popular party or game activity that involves acting out words or phrases without speaking. It is a guessing game where participants mime or use gestures to convey the meaning of a movie, book, song, or any other clue to their teammates. The objective is for the teammates to guess the word or phrase correctly within a specified time limit.

Typically, players are divided into teams, and one member from a team acts out the clue while the others try to guess. The person acting can use facial expressions, body language, and exaggerated gestures to communicate the clue. They cannot use any verbal communication or make any sounds. The team that correctly guesses the most clues within the given time frame wins the game.

Dumb charades is often played in a lively and entertaining manner, and it requires good communication skills, creativity, and the ability to think quickly. It is a fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and is commonly played at parties, gatherings, and social events.

In dumb charades, scoring can be kept in different ways depending on the rules established by the players. Here are a few common scoring methods:

1. Time-based scoring: Each team is given a specific time limit (e.g., 1 minute) to guess the word or phrase. If the team guesses correctly within the time limit, they earn a point. If they fail to guess correctly, no points are awarded.

2. Turn-based scoring: Each team takes turns acting out the clues. If their teammates correctly guess the clue within the given time, the team earns a point. If they fail to guess or exceed the time limit, no points are awarded. The turn then passes to the next team, and the process continues.

3. Multiple-guess scoring: In this method, the acting team is given a fixed amount of time to act out the clue, and their teammates can make multiple guesses during that time. Each correct guess earns the team a point. This method allows for more opportunities to score points and keeps the game engaging.

4. Penalty-based scoring: Some variations of dumb charades incorporate penalty points. For example, if the acting team speaks, makes sounds, or uses prohibited gestures, they may receive penalty points. These points can be deducted from the team's score.

The scoring method chosen is typically agreed upon by all players before the game begins. The team with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.
